Along with the ability to master new skills quickly, he comprehends business requirements with ease and designs solutions that exceed expectations. He is good at collaborating with different teams and makes every effort to bring everyone to a consensus on an approach. This was quite visible when he helped the team design the streaming analytics solution leveraging Apache Flink and RabbitMQ. He also ensured the security aspects are considered early on during the design. He took it upon himself to build the threat model and had it reviewed/approved with the security leads.<br><br>Ben has done an outstanding job of contributing to the growth of the technology in the team.

Somehow, he managed to implement lots of new features and improvements on top of all that, increasing the app's stability, functionality, and maintainability before he left for PTC. With Spacia, in a matter of months, he designed and developed a sales-ready product, implemented a scalable infrastructure to host it, and launched his own company to sell it.<br><br>When it comes to working with others, Ben is professional and conscientious, humble and enthusiastic. He is eager to share his knowledge, while also extremely willing to listen, incorporate other points of view, and cooperate on shared projects.
